                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
Hello!! I'm Soumyadip Mitra, a 19-year-old tech enthusiast and computer geek from Kolkata, India. I'm passionate about exploring how modern technology, especially computers and smartphones, operates, which naturally led me to pursue a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I'm specializing in IoT, Blockchain Technology, and Cybersecurity at the University of Engineering and Management (UEM), Kolkata. Beyond tech, I’m a melomaniac, a foodie, and a huge fan of professional wrestling and MMA. My curiosity and love for innovation drive me to constantly learn and stay on the cutting edge of technology.
               </p>
               <br>
                <p>
Aside from my college studies, I stay engaged in extracurricular courses to keep up with the latest trends and developments in the world. I enjoy working on personal projects, such as building websites and testing my skills to see how I measure up against others in the field. In my downtime, I’m a big fan of watching WWE and UFC, with music always playing in the background while I work or unwind. That’s a little bit about me!!

                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <p>
I completed my secondary schooling at The Central Modern School in Barasat, a CISCE-affiliated institution. Unfortunately, the 2021 ICSE board exams were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a score of 89%, which fell short of my expectation of over 95%. For my senior secondary education, I attended Kalyani Public School, also in Barasat, which follows the CBSE curriculum. In the 2023 CBSE exams, I achieved a score of 92.2%, which I felt was justified as I was simultaneously preparing for the JEE.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
However, my plans didn’t unfold as expected, leading me to take a drop year. In 2024, I secured a rank of 725 in the WBJEE and cleared the cutoff of JEE Advanced by scoring 93 percentile in JEE Mains paper 1, but narrowly missed the opportunity to study at an IIT due to not meeting the subject cutoff for Mathematics in JEE Advanced. Currently, I am enrolled at the University of Engineering and Management (UEM), Kolkata, where I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with specializations in IoT, Blockchain Technology, and Cybersecurity.
